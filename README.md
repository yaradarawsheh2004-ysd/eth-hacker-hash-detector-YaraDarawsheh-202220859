# Eth Hacker Hash Detector

This is a small Python tool I made to detect different types of hash strings and also to generate MD5 hashes from plain text.

Student: Yara  
Student ID:202220859 

What it can do :
- Check what type a hash is: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512
- Create an MD5 hash from any text you type
- Works in two ways: you can use it step by step (interactive) or just pass a hash directly

How to set it up :
- You only need Python 3 installed
- No extra libraries needed, just standard Python stuff

How to use

Interactive mode
```bash
python3 hash_task1.py
