# Eth Hacker Hash Detector

This is a small Python tool I made to detect different types of hash strings and also to generate MD5 hashes from plain text.

Student: Yara  
Student ID: 202220859

## What it can do
- Check what type a hash is: MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, or SHA512
- Create an MD5 hash from any text you type
- Works in two ways: interactive mode or direct argument mode

## How to set it up
- You only need Python 3 installed
- No extra libraries needed, everything uses the standard Python library

## How to use

### Interactive mode
```bash
python3 hash_task1.py
